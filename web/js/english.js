The tribe leader, UbaapNerd, was suspecting that Jacks’ arrival could represent the materialization of an ancient NERD legend. Hence, he has ordered that Jack face a challenge. If Jack wins this challenge, the tribe is going to be convicted that he is Byte, the Savior!<br />Now, help Jack to win the challenge, and avoid him to go to the cauldron.";
english[35]="This challenge is about the Requirements Engineering process. We don’t know exactly how, but the NERDS tribe is very close to this Computer area. <br />In this challenge, the NERDS are going to present to you a series of mystic stones.

However, these stones are not organized. <br />Based on the legend, just Byte, the Savior, is able to sort the stones in the proper order, what will reveal the holy stone location.";
english[36]="Congratulations, you have saved Jack! In case you still have some doubt about the requirements engineering process, check out below:<br />1.	Elicitation: Understand the problem, and collect the customers’ requirements.<br />2.	Analysis: Resolve conflicts, clarify doubts, and derive new requirements.<br />3.	Specification: document the requirements.<br />4.	Verification: Evaluate if the requirements meet objectives criteria.<br />5.	Validation: Evaluate if the requirements really meet the customers’ demands.<br />6.	Management: Maintain a common understanding about the customers and project team regarding the requirements changes.<br />Remember that these phases may be iterative, because often the requirements are completely identified only after multiples passages over each phase.";

english[61]="Now, the Holy Stone trust Jack’s abilities, and will help him to transmit the requirements for all NERDS to be able escape from the island before BigBug eruption! But, before, Jack needs to elicitate the requirements for him and the tribe leave the island with security. Take Jack to a place where he may be able to perform this activity.";
english[62]="Controlling the project cost and time are responsibilities of project manager.";

According to the legend, the explosion will happen until 22 days after Byte’s arrival.<br />The time is running… Jack has not much time.<br />So, he needs to identify the problem to be solved. Know how to identify the actual problem is one important factor for the success of a software project. A requirements analyst has to know how to distinguish the problem to the solution. But Jack has many ideas going on. Help him to separate the ideas which represent the problem from the ideas that represent the solution of this problem.";
english[66]="In this challenge, Jack listed a set of phrases to identify what is the problem that have to be solved. Help him to identify which phrases are related to the problem. To do so, you just have to click in the phrase for its selection (a selected phrase becomes written in red)";
english[67]="Check the phrases that identify Jacks’ problem:";
english[68]="The volcano is going to explode the island.";
english[69]="We need to leave the island.";
english[70]="We could hide in a deep cave and wait the eruption finish.";
english[71]="The eruption is going to happen within 22 days";
english[72]="The plane could be fixed.";
english[73]="We could stock food for many days.";
english[74]="We could build a ship with capacity for many people.";
english[75]="We need long rowing.";
english[76]="To minimize the God Bit thirsty for blood, we could perform a sacrifice.";
english[77]="A big sail could help to surpass the waves.";
english[78]="The NERDS tribe has 15 members, including men, women, and children.";
english[79]="Evaluate";
english[80]="The problem must be expressed without correlation with the solution.";
english[81]="One of Jacks problem is that he has to the NERDS tribe.";
english[82]="Congratulations!! You assisted Jack to recognize the actual problem to be solved!! To understand the answer , see the comments below:<br />The problem represents what has to be solved. Many times we thing in a possible solution even before we understand what is the actual problem to be solved. The proper identification of the problem is a key aspect for the success of requirements analysis, and as consequence for a system that really meet users’ needs.<br />In this challenge, the main problem is that the volcano are going to erupt within 22 days, and when it happens, the whole island are going to be destroyed. In this fact, there is no solution proposal, but the simply statement of a problem that have to be solved somehow. Moreover, the amount of members of NERDS tribe is another problem that has to be meet by some solution.<br />In this challenge several proposals for the solution have been presented, aiming to solve the whole problem, or just a part of it. Leave the island is a possible solution, maybe the more coherent. Still, this possible solution demands to be detailed, explaining exactly how they could leave the island. However, other solutions may be evaluated. For instance, take the tribe to a cave could solve de problem, however there are many risks involved. And at last, fix the airplane also could be considered, besides, in a later stage, this solution could be considered unviable due to its complexity.";
english[83]="Now that Jack has identified the problem to be solved, he can discuss with the holy stone about a possible solution. To do so, he must identify the functional and non-functional requirements.";
english[84]="The non-functional requirements are related to the restrictions that the solution has to meet.";
english[85]="The functional requirements are related to the functionalities the solution has to present.";
english[86]="After have been recognized as Byte by the Holy Stone, Jack already can communicate the requirements to NERDS’ tribe. Jack already walks through the island to identify the available resources to identify the requirements to solve the problem. The decision for the solution is to build a boat to leave the island, once the place is much damaged (and also that Jack does not know how to pilot it!!) and the cave is not safe enough to protect the whole tribe from the volcano. Jack has already defined the requirements, but he has doubts about how to classify them. The problem is that the Holy stone may just communicate the requirements that are correctly classified as functional or non-functional. Your responsibility is to assist Jack in the classification of the requirements he already have defined.";
english[87]="In this challenge, Jack already spread the requirements in the ground of the forest. He also separated a space to put the functional requirements and the non-functional requirements. You may move each requirement for the proper place.";
english[88]="To classify a requirement, you may move it in the correct place, accordingly with is classification.";
english[89]="The boat should have capacity to 10 people.";
english[90]="The boat should have a rudder.";
english[91]="The boat should be ready in least than 20 days.";
english[92]="The boat should have 8 oars.";
english[93]="The boat should be done with wooden.";
english[94]="The boat should have a sail.";
english[95]="The boat should be resistant to be 5 days on the sea.";
english[96]="The boat should have a box to store food.";
english[97]="Functional requirements";
english[98]="Non-functional requirements";
english[99]="Phew!!! With the requirements proper classified, the Holy Stone may communicate the requirements to the NERDS build de boat. Maybe, Jack really is able to save all.<br />During this challenge, you had to assist Jack to classify the requirements in functional and non-functional. You should remember that functional requirements are related to the actions the system has to perform (its functionalities). On the other hand, the non-functional requirements express the restrictions the software should meet or the qualities it has to possess. <br />In the boat construction, we may perform an analogy with the concepts learnt for software development. The functionalities may be understood as a rudder, a sail, or a defined set of oars, and still having a place to store food. These are related to the functionalities of a boat.<br />On the other hand, the deadline to build the boat is an external restriction imposed by the current situation (the volcano is going to explode). Then, this is a non-functional requirement. The relation to the boat capability, you may perform an analogy with a non-functional requirement of performance (in this case related to its size). The decision to build the boat with wood, also does not affect the functionalities the boat have to attend (the boat still will have rudders, a sail, etc., even if the boat would be built with aluminum from the airplane wreckage). The boat resistance is an analogy with the software robustness, in other words, the capability to resist in abnormal conditions.<br />";
english[100]="Now that the requirements are properly classified, you may assist Jack to decide what he has to do next. If jack take the requirements to the Holy Stone, it is going to be communicated to the NERDS tribe, and they are going to start the boat construction.<br />Some members of the tribe already are on the beach waiting for instructions from the Holy Stone.";
english[101]="You have forgotten to take Jack to validate the requirements with UbaapNerd in NERDS tribe. Jack has lost 4 important days. <br /> Go to the NERDS tribe to validate the requirements with UbaapNerd.";
english[102]="During the validation phase, new requirements may be found.";
english[103]="The validation aims to avoid divergences among the customer expectation and the produced results.";
english[104]="For what reasons have you came to the NERDS’ tribe?";
english[105]="Evaluate if there are new requirements.";
english[106]="Validate the requirements, documented in the Holy Stone, with UbaapNerd.";
english[107]="Invite more NERDS to build the boat.";

english[115]="Let UbaapNerd up to date about the progress of the project.";
english[116]="Avoid UbaapNerd to ask for new requirements.";
english[117]="Congratulations!<br /><br />An important factor for the Project success is that the requirements meet the necessity of customers and users.<br /><br />The requirements presentation for UbaapNerd was mandatory to identify a problem in the requirements identified by Jack. Remembering the challenge 04, Jack had documented that boat needs to has capacity for 10 people. However, the NERD’s tribe has 15 members, excluding the own Jack.<br /><br />This validation will avoid the boat to be constructed with wrong dimensions. Yet, UbaapNerd has informed that the GEEK’s tribe has asked for truce. However, they also need to believe that Jack is Byte, the Savior! Go to the GEEKS’ tribe to for a new challenge.<br /> Good luck!<br />";
english[118]="The GEEKS’ tribe has asked for truce to UbaapNerd!! They want to escape the island, but first, they have to believe in Jack.<br /><br />Hence, Jack need to prove that he is Byte, the Savior!! If he do not pass for this challenge, the GEEKS are going to sacrifice Jack as one last try to appease the Big Bug!<br /><br />In the same way Jack as proven to NERDS, he will need to rearrange a set of stones to demonstrate the correct order to manage the requirements change. Good luck!";
english[119]="Congratulation!! You have assistged Jack to prove to the GEEKS that he really is Byte, the Savior!!<br /><br />The correct sequence to handle a change request is:<br /><br />Step 1: Record the change request.<br /><br />Step 2: Evaluate the change impact (typically based on the traceability)<br /><br />Step 3: Determine if the change viability based on the impact analysis and other factors.<br /><br />Step 4: Review the planning to accommodate the changes.<br /><br />Step 5: Review the related work products and the traceability.<br /><br />Now that Jack is ready to handle that requirements change requests, go to the beach, where the NERDS are waiting for instructions.";
